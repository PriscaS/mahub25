				<h2>Etiquette</h2>
				<p>We look forward to our year together, to all the conversation and discussions, the collaborations and sharing of ideas. This page is intended to set some ground rules to ensure that everyone will feel comfortable, safe, and included. Let's consider this a guide to our teamwork &mdash; may it be productive and enjoyable  ãƒ„</p>
				<h3>Let's all agree to...</h3>
				<ul class="etiquette">
					<li>
						<strong>... be punctual.</strong>
						<p>Our sessions together will be quite intensive because there's a lot of ground to cover. We'll start promptly, so please aim to arrive early to give yourself time to get comfortable.</p>
						<!-- toggle link -->
						<input id="punctual-info" class="toggle" type="checkbox">
						<label for="punctual-info" class="lbl-toggle info">more info</label>
						<!-- / toggle link -->
						<div class="tog-wrap">
							<p>Let's agree to be on time for all our sessions. Punctuality is really a matter of common courtesy, respecting everyone's time. Late arrivals are distracting for both your lecturers and fellow students.</p>
							<p>If you are delayed, try to let us (David, Prisca or Fabiana) know via a DM in Slack and join the session discretely as soon as you can. Be prepared to catch up on anything you missed by asking your fellow students and using the online materials after the session has ended.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>... be kind &amp; respectful.</strong>
						<p>We see our programme as one learning team, one big group of creative thinkers who will flourish through collaboration. Respect and understanding are therefore part of our philosophy to foster a positive spirit for us all.</p>
						<!-- toggle link -->
						<input id="kind-info" class="toggle" type="checkbox">
						<label for="kind-info" class="lbl-toggle info">more info</label>
						<!-- / toggle link -->
						<div class="tog-wrap">
							<p>Our programme is likely a little different than you might expect - we will aim for lots of discussion and collaboration. This is the nature of working on the web and our approach will help you develop good employability skills. This means we will all be open to all views, open to different opinions and keen to share ideas. Inclusivity is paramount. Let's embrace our differences, be accepting and supportive of each other.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>... be considerate.</strong>
						<p>Let's bear in mind how our ways of listening, note taking, and learning will differ and aim to keep the room quiet. Let's ensure that our digital devices remain muted during our sessions and let's remain focused on our current discussions and relevant topics.</p>
						<!-- toggle link -->
						<input id="considerate-info" class="toggle" type="checkbox">
						<label for="considerate-info" class="lbl-toggle info">more info</label>
						<!-- / toggle link -->
						<div class="tog-wrap">
							<p>Our sessions will be most productive if we can all focus on the subject and activity in hand. This means listening to whoever is talking and being ready to share our views when prompted. Distractions caused by electronic messaging or chatting will be disruptive and hinder this process.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>... be open-minded.</strong>
						<p>One of the most wonderful aspects of design work, especially for the web, lies in collaboration and feedback cycles. This means that input from anyone should be welcomed because it will help to positively shape our work.</p>
						<!-- toggle link -->
						<input id="input-info" class="toggle" type="checkbox">
						<label for="input-info" class="lbl-toggle info">more info</label>
						<!-- / toggle link -->
						<div class="tog-wrap">
							<p>If you are used to this process already, brilliant! And if not, aim to adapt an open-minded attitude and take on board all opinions and views. It is important to bear in mind that design never succeeds in isolation. After all, any design has a clear objective and is produced with people in mind. Our subjective views are only ever starting points.</p>
							<p>Only if we listen to how people perceive and interpret our designs can we be sure that our intended outcome is achieved. Whether someone has lots of experience in design, or none, all views count and will contribute to the evolution of our work.</p>
							<p>Commitment to teamwork means that we will give everyone the same attention and care. We will rely on each other for honest feedback, constructive criticism as well as hands-on help with all project work. By supporting each other in this way we will learn from each other; we will learn both by giving and receiving help.</p>
