				For the final crit before you begin your MP project work, you will have to have a clear idea of how your project will now materialise. This will be what your presentation should cover, from a description and rationale to a demo of a prototype. 
			</p>
				<p>We will also need to see a clear schedule of your plans. The most effective will be the Gantt chart (for details: view <a href="https://www.gantt.com/">gantt.com</a>). To create your wondeful masterpieces, planning and keeping an eye on your schedule will be key. Here are a few prompts and tips that might help ツ 
			</p>
			<h2>Notes</h2>
			<p>
				The most important part about planning for this big chunk of work will be for you to find what works best for you in terms of setting yourself suitable milestones. Life can easily get in the way and it is best to have a clear outline of the work that you will need to complete to meet your deadlines. How you will do this is entirely up to you ツ
			</p>
			
			<div class="notes">
				
				<div><h3>Tips</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>split the project up into phases</li>
					<li>be as specific or as general as you like -
						but make sure to divide the work logically</li>
					<li>plan for writes and re-writes &amp; importantly: ask for feedback so you can fine-tune your content and design</li>
					<li>schedule in time for optimisation and testing</li>
					<li>check your progress against your plan and update your schedule to fit</li>
				</ul></div>

					<p>Which tool you use for your planning is up to you, the tool is unimportant compared to the planning itself. Pen and paper, calendars or spreadsheets - whatever works best for you :)</p>

					
					<h4>ideal stages of project work</h4>
					<p>At this point you will (hopefully) have your concept decided upon and you can start on merely fine-tuning your idea and start on the work itself.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<strong>Concept development</strong>
							Take a moment to clearly define your project. It will be best to have a well thought-out rationale for all aspects of your idea: from the problem you're hoping to solve, the brand persona and voice and importantly who your target group will be. Do thorough research to ensure that your site's content as well as design will deliver well.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Content production, editing and final optimisations </strong>
							This is the most important intial work you should focus on. Without content, your project cannot be planned in terms of user interaction or final presentation. This is also an activity that would likely take up a lot of your time and you should aim for having at least some exemplary content in hand as soon as practically possible. You will likely preview and edit all the way through the summer.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Design and development work</strong>
							With some exemplary content in hand, you can begin on the branding and evolve your initial ideas to now fit both the content and project mission. We would recommend that you work in parallel between the  learning of the necessary development skills while working on the design. This means you can give your brain a break in between tasks — and hopefully don't burn out ツ <br>
							And you can make progress on preparing for the final coding while the design is being developed. this stage will span across quite a period of time and hopefully you will by now have a feeling of how to best be productive. Your schedule should serve as a path to follow. It would be best if you would revise it frequently. You can then adjust your daily work accordingly and ensure you remain on track to meet the deadlines.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Report</strong>
							Hopefully you will already have part of your report in hand via the write ups of the previous crits. This is a substantial piece of writing and it could soon become a monster of a task. Our advice is to right this on an ongoing basis. After the prototype crit, for example, you can add to the report already by making note of the feedback you received and how this might now shape the first stages of the project work. If you add to it by reporting on the different stages of your work as you go along - you will find that you will have completed a substantial part of the report quite easily.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<h3>Gantt chart example</h3>
					<p>To give you an idea of what a schedule for this project might look like, here is one example of a breakdown of related work and timings.</p>
					<img src="../vis/project-planning/project-plan_GanttChart_example.png" alt="gantt chart example" width="2300" height="1216">
					<p>You are welcome to use this <a href="../vis/project-planning/project-plan_GanttChart_blank.xlsx.zip">blank spreadsheet (.xlsx)</a> as starting point ツ But do edit it all to fit your project and your plans specifically ~ this is a mere outline and quite general only.</p>
					<h3>Good luck!</h3>
					<p>
						Remember that we will have our online meetings every two weeks, and then there's Slack of course as well. Please do share your progress and ask lots of questions. We will always be happy to help ツ<br>
						Do tell us of your highlights of the little successes you will have, or have a little cry when things go wrong ~ we are a big team and we will be there to help each other out.
